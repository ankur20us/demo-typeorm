# demo-typeorm
Basic demo to understand the typeorm for repository pattern.

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Run `npm start` command

Note: 

This project works when the database server is preinstalled, locally or in cloud, also database is available to the orm. Like in our case, "POSTGRES" should be preinstalled and also db "test" should be avalilable.
